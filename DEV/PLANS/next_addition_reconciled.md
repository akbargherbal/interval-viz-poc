## 🟢 Tier 0 — Full Consensus, Lowest Risk (Implement First)
Algorithms both documents clearly agree on, with minimal infrastructure cost and strong pedagogical value.

1. **Quick Sort**  
   - Strong visual fit (ArrayView)
   - High pedagogical and industry relevance
   - Excellent prediction points

2. **Kadane’s Algorithm (Maximum Subarray)**  
   - Minimal infra
   - Opens Dynamic Programming category
   - Strong learner decision points

3. **Insertion Sort**  
   - Trivial to implement
   - Beginner‑friendly
   - Clear visual pattern

## 🟡 Tier 1 — Low Risk, Visual‑First Bias (Fast Wins)
Algorithms strongly favored by the visual‑reuse strategy and acceptable (or neutral) from a curriculum perspective.

4. **Merge Intervals**  
   - Reuses TimelineView
   - Simple binary decisions

5. **Meeting Rooms (I / II)**  
   - Interval stacking logic
   - High interview relevance

6. **Container With Most Water**  
   - Classic two‑pointer pattern
   - Clean binary pointer decisions

7. **Dutch National Flag (Sort Colors)**  
   - Distinct three‑pointer state
   - Strong visual clarity

8. **Boyer–Moore Voting Algorithm**  
   - Counter‑intuitive logic benefits from visualization
   - Low implementation cost

---

## 🟠 Tier 2 — Pedagogically Strong, Strategic Trade‑offs
Algorithms valued for curriculum depth but with either limited visual ROI or higher conceptual complexity.

9. **Bubble Sort**  
   - Extremely easy to visualize
   - Pedagogically weaker (low conceptual ceiling)
   - Optional / beginner‑only use

10. **Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)**  
   - Reinforces DP patterns
   - Moderate complexity
   - Acceptable with existing ArrayView + DP overlay

---

## 🔴 Tier 3 — Infrastructure‑Dependent (Deferred Until Enabled)
Algorithms whose value is acknowledged by both documents, but blocked primarily by missing or costly visualization infrastructure.

11. **Depth‑First Search (DFS)**  
   - High curriculum impact
   - Requires GraphView + stack visualization

12. **Breadth‑First Search (BFS)**  
   - Complements DFS
   - Requires queue visualization

13. **Topological Sort (Kahn’s Algorithm)**  
   - DAG‑specific
   - Depends on graph + in‑degree overlays

14. **Dijkstra’s Shortest Path**  
   - Requires priority queue visualization
   - Higher state complexity

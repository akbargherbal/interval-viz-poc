## Brief Implementation Plan: Next 2-3 Sessions

### **Session 35: Phase 1 - Base Infrastructure**

**Goal:** Update codebase to support narrative generation

**Tasks:**
1. Review current `base_tracer.py` structure
2. Add abstract `generate_narrative(trace_result: dict) -> str` method
3. Add validation hook in `_build_trace_result()` (optional - can defer)
4. Create `docs/narratives/` directory structure:
   ```
   docs/narratives/
   ├── binary-search/
   └── interval-coverage/
   ```
5. Create `backend/scripts/generate_narratives.py` utility script
   - Takes algorithm name + example name
   - Executes algorithm with example input
   - Calls `generate_narrative()`
   - Saves to `docs/narratives/[algorithm]/[example].md`

**Deliverables:**
- Updated `base_tracer.py` with abstract method
- Working utility script
- Empty narrative directories ready

**Estimated Duration:** 1-2 hours

### **Session 36: Phase 2 - Binary Search Pilot**

**Goal:** Implement and validate narrative generation for Binary Search

**Tasks:**
1. Implement `generate_narrative()` in `BinarySearchTracer`
   - Reference BACKEND_CHECKLIST.md example pattern
   - Show ALL decision data (target value, mid value, comparisons)
   - Make temporal flow clear
2. Run utility script for all 6 Binary Search examples
3. Review generated narratives (self-review using 4 criteria)
4. Fix any issues found
5. QA pilot review (using QA_INTEGRATION_CHECKLIST.md Phase 1 template)
   - Time the review process
   - Document findings
   - Test feedback format (WHAT not HOW)

**Deliverables:**
- `BinarySearchTracer.generate_narrative()` implemented
- 6 narrative files in `docs/narratives/binary-search/`
- QA review template filled out
- Lessons learned documented

**Estimated Duration:** 2-3 hours

---

### **Session 37: Phase 2 - Interval Coverage + Workflow Validation**

**Goal:** Complete pilot implementation and validate workflow

**Tasks:**
1. Implement `generate_narrative()` in `IntervalCoverageTracer`
   - Show interval decisions (keep/covered/discard)
   - Show comparison data (interval.start vs max_end)
   - Show call stack context
2. Run utility script for all 4 Interval Coverage examples
3. QA pilot review
4. Compare findings between Binary Search and Interval Coverage
5. **Evaluate v2.0 Workflow:**
   - Did narrative generation take <1 hour per algorithm?
   - Did QA review take ~15-20 minutes per algorithm?
   - Did narratives catch missing data issues?
   - Would this have prevented past bugs?
6. Document any workflow adjustments needed

**Deliverables:**
- `IntervalCoverageTracer.generate_narrative()` implemented
- 4 narrative files in `docs/narratives/interval-coverage/`
- QA review templates for both algorithms
- Workflow evaluation report
- Recommendations for improvements (if any)

**Estimated Duration:** 2-3 hours

---

### **Success Criteria After 3 Sessions:**

✅ Both algorithms have `generate_narrative()` implemented  
✅ All 10 examples (6 + 4) have narrative files  
✅ QA review process tested and timed  
✅ Workflow validated (or adjustments identified)  
✅ Ready to add Algorithm #3 using proven v2.0 workflow

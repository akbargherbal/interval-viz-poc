## Risk Analysis

### Implementation Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Technical complexity exceeds estimates | Low | Medium | Registry architecture proven; all 3 reuse ArrayView |
| Narrative quality issues | Low | Medium | FAA audit process (v2.1) catches errors early |
| Student confusion with patterns | Medium | Low | Clear progression: start with Two Pointer (simplest) |
| Integration bugs | Low | High | Compliance framework ensures quality gates |

### Market Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Competitors copy pattern approach | Medium | Medium | First-mover advantage; registry architecture is unique |
| Pattern teaching doesn't resonate | Low | High | Industry data shows pattern recognition is #1 interview skill |
| Overengineering (too many features) | Low | Medium | Stop at 5 algorithms initially; validate market response |

**Overall Risk Level:** ✅ **LOW** (proven architecture + validated market need)

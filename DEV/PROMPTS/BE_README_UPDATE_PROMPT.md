Two major improvements have been made recently:
1. The new workflow; see `docs/compliance/WORKFLOW.md`
2. The successful refactoring of the backend
However, `README.md` has not been updated to reflect the new reality regarding the backend or the workflow. `README.md` has undergone significant downsizing, from 1,800 lines to 800 lines, so that it now contains only essential information and omits detailed explanations. The plan is to keep `README.md` this lean.
Therefore, when working with `README.md`, we must only verify and fact-check existing information related to the current workflow and backend architecture to keep it up to date. Please do not add any new non-essential information (even if it may be useful). Check only for critical or important information that requires updating.

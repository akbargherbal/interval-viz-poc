The frontend has been successfully refactored according to the *Frontend Architecture Consistency: Implementation Plan*; see `REFACTORING_FE_PHASED_PLAN.md`. While things are working, no tests have yet been created to reflect the new reality on the ground.

The backend has also been refactored successfully and thoroughly tested. However, the current frontend test suite dates back to the proof-of-concept stage, and most of it is now obsolete.

My objective for this session is to conduct a thorough study of the current frontend testing environment and create a testing strategy for the frontend, similar to what we did for the backend. Based on this testing strategy, we will write a phased plan in the next session, and then, over multiple subsequent sessions, execute that plan.

All testing must be conducted in accordance with the Frontend Compliance Checklist; see: `docs/compliance/FRONTEND_CHECKLIST.md`.

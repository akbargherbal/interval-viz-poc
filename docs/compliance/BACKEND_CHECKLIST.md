### Narrative Generation (NEW in v2.0)

- [ ] **Implements `generate_narrative(trace_result: dict) -> str`**
  - Abstract method from `AlgorithmTracer` base class
  - Converts own trace JSON to human-readable markdown
  - Must be implemented (will raise NotImplementedError if not)

- [ ] **Narrative generated for ALL registered examples**
  - Every example in `registry.py` has corresponding narrative
  - Files saved to `docs/narratives/[algorithm-name]/[example-name].md`
  - Naming convention: `example_1_basic.md`, `example_2_edge_case.md`, etc.

- [ ] **Narrative generation does NOT fail**

  - No missing field references
  - Fails loudly if data incomplete (this is good - catches bugs!)

- [ ] **Narrative passes FAA arithmetic audit (NEW in v2.1)**
  - Submit narratives to FAA review using `FAA_PERSONA.md`
  - Address all arithmetic errors flagged by FAA
  - Resubmit until FAA approves (blocking requirement)
  - See Stage 1.5 in WORKFLOW.md for details

- [ ] **Self-review completed before FAA submission**
  - [ ] Can I follow the algorithm logic from narrative alone?

## Example: Binary Search Validation

```python
# Quick validation script
def validate_binary_search_trace():
    tracer = BinarySearchTracer()
    result = tracer.execute({'array': [1,3,5,7,9], 'target': 5})

    # LOCKED requirements
    assert result['metadata']['algorithm'] == 'binary-search'
    assert result['metadata']['display_name'] == 'Binary Search'
    assert result['metadata']['visualization_type'] == 'array'
    assert result['metadata']['input_size'] == 5

    # CONSTRAINED requirements
    step = result['trace']['steps'][0]
    assert 'visualization' in step['data']
    assert 'array' in step['data']['visualization']
    assert len(step['data']['visualization']['array']) == 5
    assert 'pointers' in step['data']['visualization']

    # Prediction constraints
    if 'prediction_points' in result['metadata']:
        for pred in result['metadata']['prediction_points']:
            assert len(pred['choices']) <= 3, "HARD LIMIT VIOLATED"

    # NEW: Narrative validation
    narrative = tracer.generate_narrative(result)
    assert isinstance(narrative, str), "Narrative must be string"
    assert len(narrative) > 0, "Narrative cannot be empty"
    assert "Step 0" in narrative, "Narrative must include step information"
    
    # Save narrative for FAA audit (NEW in v2.1)
    output_path = f"docs/narratives/binary-search/basic_example.md"
    with open(output_path, 'w') as f:
        f.write(narrative)

    print("✅ Binary Search trace is compliant")
    print(f"✅ Narrative saved to {output_path}")
    print("⏳ Next: Submit to FAA audit using FAA_PERSONA.md")
```

## Narrative Generation Pattern Example

```python
class BinarySearchTracer(AlgorithmTracer):
    def generate_narrative(self, trace_result: dict) -> str:
        """
        Convert trace JSON to human-readable markdown narrative.
        
        CRITICAL: This method must show ALL decision data.
        If you reference a variable, SHOW its value.
        All arithmetic must be correct (FAA will verify).
        """
        narrative = "# Binary Search Execution Narrative\n\n"
        narrative += f"**Input:** Array of {trace_result['metadata']['input_size']} elements\n"
        narrative += f"**Target:** {self.target}\n\n"
        
        for step in trace_result['trace']['steps']:
            step_num = step['step']
            step_type = step['type']
            description = step['description']
            viz = step['data']['visualization']
            
            narrative += f"## Step {step_num}: {description}\n\n"
            
            # Show visualization state with ALL relevant data
            array = viz['array']
            pointers = viz['pointers']
            
            narrative += f"**Array State:**\n"
            narrative += f"```\n"
            for elem in array:
                marker = ""
                if elem['index'] == pointers['left']:
                    marker += "L"
                if elem['index'] == pointers['mid']:
                    marker += "M"
                if elem['index'] == pointers['right']:
                    marker += "R"
                narrative += f"[{elem['index']}]: {elem['value']} ({elem['state']}) {marker}\n"
            narrative += f"```\n\n"
            
            # Show decision with VISIBLE data
            if step_type == 'COMPARE':
                mid_value = array[pointers['mid']]['value']
                narrative += f"**Decision:** Compare target ({self.target}) with mid value ({mid_value})\n"
                
                if self.target == mid_value:
                    narrative += f"**Result:** {self.target} == {mid_value} → FOUND at index {pointers['mid']}\n\n"
                elif self.target < mid_value:
                    narrative += f"**Result:** {self.target} < {mid_value} → Search LEFT half\n\n"
                else:
                    narrative += f"**Result:** {self.target} > {mid_value} → Search RIGHT half\n\n"
        
        return narrative
```

**Key Principles:**
1. Show ALL data referenced in decisions
2. Make comparisons explicit with actual values
3. Explain outcomes clearly
4. Use code blocks for complex state
5. Fail loudly (KeyError) if data missing
6. **Ensure all arithmetic is correct (FAA will verify) ← NEW in v2.1**

## Quick Reference: Visualization Types

| Type       | When to Use                      | Required Fields                     |
| ---------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `array`    | Sorting, searching arrays        | `array`, `pointers` (optional)      |
| `timeline` | Intervals, time-based algorithms | `all_intervals`, `call_stack_state` |
| `graph`    | DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, etc.         | `graph.nodes`, `graph.edges`        |
| `tree`     | Tree traversals, heaps           | TBD (future)                        |

---

## Approval Criteria

✅ **PASS** - All LOCKED requirements met, CONSTRAINED contract followed, narratives generated, FAA approved  
⚠️ **MINOR ISSUES** - Free choices questionable but acceptable  
❌ **FAIL** - LOCKED requirements violated, return to development

**NEW in v2.1:** Narratives must pass FAA arithmetic audit before QA review.

---

## Workflow Integration (v2.1)

**Stage 1: Backend Implementation**

1. ✅ Implement tracer class
2. ✅ Implement `generate_narrative()` method
3. ✅ Run unit tests
4. ✅ Generate narratives for ALL registered examples
5. ✅ **Submit narratives to FAA audit (using `FAA_PERSONA.md`)**
6. ✅ **Fix arithmetic errors, regenerate until FAA passes**
7. ✅ Self-review narratives (use checklist above)
8. ✅ Complete this checklist
9. ✅ Submit PR with code + FAA-approved narratives + checklist

**Next Stage:** QA Narrative Review (see QA_INTEGRATION_CHECKLIST.md)

**Note:** QA assumes arithmetic has been verified by FAA. QA focuses on logical completeness and pedagogical quality.

---

## FAA Audit Process (NEW in v2.1)

**When:** After generating narratives, before QA submission  
**Reference:** `docs/compliance/FAA_PERSONA.md`  
**Expected Time:** 10-15 minutes initial audit, 5 minutes re-audit

**Process:**
1. Submit all generated narratives to FAA review
2. FAA verifies every quantitative claim with calculation
3. If errors found: Fix and regenerate, resubmit to FAA
4. If no errors: FAA approves, proceed to checklist completion
5. Submit PR with FAA-approved narratives

**What FAA Checks:**
- ✅ Arithmetic correctness (20 - 10 = 10, not 20)
- ✅ State transition math (variables update correctly)
- ✅ Quantitative claims consistency
- ✅ Visualization-text alignment

**What FAA Does NOT Check:**
- ❌ Pedagogical quality
- ❌ Narrative completeness
- ❌ Writing style

**Cost-Benefit:** 2 hours of FAA back-and-forth beats 2 days of integration debugging.

---

**Remember:** 
- If your tracer requires changes to `base_tracer.py`, you've misunderstood the architecture
- If your narrative has undefined variable references, you've missed required visualization data
- If your narrative has arithmetic errors, FAA will catch them (this is good!)
- Narratives that fail to generate = bugs caught early (this is good!)
